# BiggerBotChess
## UCI Chess engine written in c++.

This project started as a way to learn to write clean and performant c++ code. I studied the code of Stockfish 17.1 and tried to make my own simpler engine by following the example.

The engine right now has bearly any functionality but i will add more in the upcoming weeks and months.

The bot is live on lichess: [link](https://lichess.org/@/BiggerBotChess)

### Building From source
There are 2 way of building this project:
- CMake (Debugging and Development)
- Make (Release)

I you want to just build the engine you should use this:

```
cd src
make
```
And then just run the `BiggerBotChess` executable.
